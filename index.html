            <p> Hi, I’m Laura Wentzell Ahmad, and I come from a creative background, I’ve worked on many projects in varying roles within the wardrobe and makeup departments. I’ve diversified and grown along the way expanding skills and acquiring the many hats that allow me connect effectively with the artistic teams, business teams, and now software developers. Attention to detail has been the continual thread.</p>
            <p>
            I have a talent for learning skills quickly while never losing sight of what matters, the users, and their interaction with the end creation, be that a film, a DAM, an application or a web site. </p>
            <p>When I'm not desperatly searching around for the way to plug into the matrix and absorbe all this coding language, I spend my time researching the one thing that will be my assured forever home, the Human body. I love/ am obsessed over knowing how the food we eat, and the things we absorb through our skin effect our bodies and the way we experience the world. It's a never ending discovery and as much as I try I just can't seem to say no to the next nutrition book. That's my true version of netflix and chill.</p>
